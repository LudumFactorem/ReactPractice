This is a project for practicing web development.

We intend to use:
React in TypeScript
React uses JSX
Bootstrap
Webpack
AWS

Formatting:
•Prettier (https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html)
•In Visual Studio Code it can be found in "Extensions" by searching "Prettier"
•You should also enable Manage>Settings>"Editor: Format On Save"
•Lastly, when in a .tsx file, View>Command Palette...>"Format Document"
•This should bring up a pop-up telling you there is a formatter conflict. Select Prettier as your formatter.
•React components should be in "PascalCase" (CamelCase where the first letter is also capital)
•React components should be a one liner:
export default function Component() {

    }

•as opposed to:
function Component() {

    }
    export default Component

•Variables should be regular camelCase.
